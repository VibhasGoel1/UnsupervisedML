Perplexity is a good indication of the performance of the model, however it should not be the sole criteria to choose the topic number as it doesnt take into account the interpretability of the topics. Perplexity is biased to the size of the dataset as well. Alarger dataset will have lower perplexity score. Other metrics like coherence should also be taken into account."

We believe that coherence would be a better metric as compared to perplexity. Coherence is a measure of the interpretability and meaningfulness of the topics generated by the LDA model. We could choose the topic numbers as 15 as it has low perplexity and higher coherence value. We could also see that when topic number was 15 perplexity score was -9.05 and coherence was 0.394. This topic number covers various aspects of products reviewed such as battery, headset, bluetooth, phone cases and chargers. Topics seem to have relatively clear and distinct interpretations when the topic number is 15."

Beta represents topic-word density - with a high beta, topics are made up of most of the words in the corpus, and with a low beta they consist of few words."
